\section{Introduction and motivation}

When one speaks about the numerical solution of ODEs, one 
usually has in mind initial value problems for equations 
of the form 

$$
{\d u_1\over\d x}=g_1(u_1, u_2, \dots, u_m, x),
$$
\be\label{one}
\vdots
\ee
$$
{\d u_m\over\d x}=g_m(u_1, u_2, \dots, u_m, x).
$$
These are solved in a finite time interval $(0,T)$ using various time-stepping 
methods. There are tons of those and some are quite sophisticated (meaning 
multistep, higher-order, adaptive, etc.). But all of them have the following 
common shortcomings:
\begin{itemize}
\item We would like to prescribe the initial value at $t = 0$ for some solution 
      components and the end-time values at $t = T$ for others. Standard 
      time stepping methods do not allow this.
\item Global error control is problematic. One only can regulate the time step
      size locally -- this is something like 
      "forward mesh refinement''. But one cannot do "backward mesh refinement''
      or coarsening easily. 
\item We would like to prescribe a tolerance for the global error and then 
      have the problem solved adaptively until this error tolerance is reached,
      without underresolving or overresolving too much. This is virtually 
      impossible with adaptive time stepping methods. 
\item Standard time integration methods cannot change their order during the 
      computation. For example, an adaptive RK4 method remains 4-order 
      all the time. This is an analogy for $h$-refinement in FEM, and obviously 
      it is highly inefficient. Correctly, the method should either do small low-order
      steps or large high-order steps to be efficient. We would like to see such an 
      analogy of $hp$-refinement in ODE methods. 
\item We would like to solve more general ODEs than (\ref{one}).
\end{itemize}
This is why we decided to apply the $hp$-FEM methodology to ODEs and see what happens.

\section{Equations}

We implemented the first version of Hermes1D during one day while 
returning from the 2009 SIAM CSE conference. First we considered the 
form (\ref{one}) but then we realized that with no extra work we can actually 
assume a much more general implicit form

$$
f_1(u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_m, u'_1, u'_2, \ldots, u'_m, x) = 0,
$$
\be\label{two}
\vdots
\ee
$$
f_m(u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_m, u'_1, u'_2, \ldots, u'_m, x) = 0.
$$
Note that (\ref{two}) contains (\ref{one}) as a special case.
In fact, (\ref{two}) can be written shortly as 
\be\label{qqq}
\bfF(\bfU, \bfU', x) = 0
\ee
where ${\bfU} = (u_1,\dots,u_m)$ and ${\bfF} = (f_1,\dots,f_m)$. 

\subsubsection*{Boundary conditions}

So far, we 
have considered Dirichlet boundary conditions only, which can be imposed
either at the initial time $t = 0$ or the end-time $t = T$. Exactly one 
condition per solution component has to be defined.



\section{$hp$-FEM discretization}

As always, the finite element discretization starts from a weak formulation.
With (\ref{two}), the situation is easy and we have 

$$
R_1(\bfY) = \int_0^T f_1(u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_m, u'_1, u'_2, \ldots, u'_m, x)v_1 \, \d t = 0,
$$
\be\label{three}
\vdots
\ee
$$
R_N(\bfY) = \int_0^T f_m(u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_m, u'_1, u'_2, \ldots, u'_m, x)v_N \, \d t = 0.
$$
Here $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_N$ are all basis functions for all solution components
(we can describe this more accurately if needed).
In the standard sense, all basis functions corresponding to the solution component $u_i$ 
are zero where $u_i$ has a Dirichlet boundary condition.
The vector $\bfY = (y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_N)$ comprises all unknown coefficients 
of the finite element basis functions for all solution components. The meshes
for the solution components $u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_m$ could (more precisely: {\em should})
be different but for now we assume that they are the same. 

\section{Newton's method}

We will drive the residual vector $\bfR = (R_1, R_2, \ldots, R_N)$ to zero using the Newton's
method. For that, we need the Jacobi matrix D$\bfR/$D$\bfY$. 

Let $1 \le i, j \le N$. 
It is easy to calculate that 
$$
\frac{\partial R_i}{\partial y_j} 
= \int_0^T \frac{\partial f_{m(i)}}{\partial u_{m(j)}}(u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_m, u'_1, u'_2, \ldots, u'_m, x)v_jv_i
$$
\be\label{newt1}
+ \frac{\partial f_{m(i)}}{\partial u'_{m(j)}}(u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_m, u'_1, u'_2, \ldots, u'_m, x)v'_jv_i \, \d t = 0.
\ee
Here, the function $m(i)$ takes a global index $1 \le i \le N$ and returns the index of the 
function $f_{m(i)}$ which is associated with $R_i$. Analogously, $m(j)$ takes 
a global index $1 \le j \le N$ and returns the index of the solution component $u_{m(i)}$ 
where the basis function $v_j$ belongs to.

The integral in (\ref{newt1}) has two parts because 
the functions $u_s$ and $u'_s$ depend on the same solution coefficients.
Do not be confused by the derivatives with respect to $u'_{m(j)}$ in (\ref{newt1}). 
The functions $u_s$ and $u'_s$ are used as independent variables for the differentiation.


\section{Numerical examples}

COMING SOON

\section{TODO list}

Currently, the code can handle an arbitrary number of equations 
and solve them with elements up to the 10th degree. However, 
the meshes still have to be equidistant, same for every solution 
component, and the polynomial degree must be the same for all
elements. The code is not $hp$-adaptive yet. These things will be 
fixed as time permits.
